                <p>Bright, smart, motivated individual with a strong work ethic, who is looking to progress. I have experience in Management, Civils, Automotive Industry, Logistics, Engineering, Operations and Warehousing. Also managed teams at Jaguar Land Rover and City Electrical Factor.

            <div class="Challenges">
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>Have faced many challenges life. Whilst at school I had a spine operation. This had a huge effect on my confidence undertaking sport's activities. I attended Physiotherapy and with the support of my friends and family, I slowly gained back my lost confidence. I had two further spine operations after this, which I was able to deal with in a much better way.</p>
                <p>Lost my passport in another country once. This can be an extremely stressful. Contacted the British Embassy. I had to provide extensive amount of information to be issued with a temporary Passport with a limited travel window. Planned route carefully as to not elapse the limited travel window. During this situation I had to remain calm and keep a positive attitude that this will be resolved, and I will be able to travel back to the UK.</p>
                <p>One of my most challenging working days was at Jaguar Land Rover. Were over 250 vehicles leaving to the G20 world summit in London. The week leading up to this all vehicles went through the workshop, being inspected for safety and quality. I managed a team of 7 personal to provide vehicle logistic support across site. To deal with this demanding load, I delegate more responsibility to team members with the right skills and experience, to make calls of judgement. Reducing pressure on the management to carry more important tasks/duties in hand.</p>

Steven's knowledge of both our customer's needs and processes was only matched by his attention to detail, and he was often sort out by senior managers for his insight into operational issues.
